# README #

This is a reference implementation of the Cardboard.Server that reads data from TFS. It is a clone of the web site that was used for the scrum board of the Azure Portal Team with some strings rewritten.

### How to use? ###

This is meant as a reference implementation and will not run out of the box against your TFS server. This is because it was written against the TFS server used by the Azure team in Microsoft (which has many custom field names). It will give you an idea of how to write the TFS back end for the cardboard server.

### Requirements ###
* VS2013
* Typescript 1.4

### What about TFS Online? ###
If there is community interest, this site can be updated to work against a vanilla TFS Online server. Let me know if this is something that would help.
